# Thesis-Project-HR-Helper-
The deliverable of the project “HR Helper: Automatic Questionnaire Generation” is the web application designed with the help of Streamlit Python library. It selects the necessary tests based on required candidate characteristics and publishes them for candidates to complete.
The GitHub includes two main files tests_matching.ipynb and tests_upload.ipynb, moreover the GitHub also provides visuals needed for tests such as Ravens matrices files a1.gif-e12.gif and numerical reasoning(cognitive ability test) table1.png – table4.png. For most tests predefined constructs are used, for job knowledge question generation with the help of LLM namely GPT-2 is used.
For correct work of the application it is necessary to run tests_matching.ipynb file together with the dataset for tests and skills.   When running the code at the end will be provided a link at which you can access the interface where you can load the desired candidate characteristics. Also, the possibility for customization is provided. After finishing with tests selection all the selected tests can be found in selected_tests.csv file. This file is used to run tests_upload.ipynb together with the files a1-e12.gif and table1.png – table4.png used in tests’ questions. Before running it would be asked to enter email that would be used to store results
